Add the remaining ingredients to the pan and bring to the boil, stirring occasionally to make sure it doesnâ€™t stick to the bottom. Leave to simmer for a further 2 minutes, then take off the heat.",

        "Garnish with some chilli flakes and fresh coriander (or other fresh herb of your choice), and serve with your hot pittas, chopped into soldiers, and some rice or couscous."
