        "Put the frozen peas into a bowl of boiling water to thaw.",
        "Peel and finely chop the garlic and ginger. Finely slice the chilli, removing the seeds if you don’t like it too spicy. Finely slice the scallions. Cut the cauliflower/broccoli florets off the stalk and chop them into small bite-size pieces. Dessed and finely chop the red pepper.",
        "Put the oil into a large pan over a high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the garlic, ginger, chilli and scallions and cook for 1½ minutes, stirring regularly.",
        "Next, add the cauliflower/broccoli, red pepper and cumin seeds and cook for 2 minutes, stirring regularly. Drain the peas and add these along with the remaining korma ingredients, bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer for 2 minutes.",
        "Remove from the heat. Roughly chop the coriander and sprinkle over each serving, along with some flaked almonds and our old favourite – chilli flakes!"
